## General Information
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC

- The data set consists of the following diseases Images:

    - Actinic keratosis
    - Basal cell carcinoma
    - Dermatofibroma
    - Melanoma
    - Nevus
    - Pigmented benign keratosis
    - Seborrheic keratosis
    - Squamous cell carcinoma
    - Vascular lesion

## Conclusions
- In terms of accurately identifying various forms of skin cancer, the constructed CNN model exhibits encouraging results. The model can help dermatologists diagnose melanoma and other types of skin cancer by utilizing deep learning techniques and data augmentation. By assembling more varied and balanced datasets and adjusting the model design, further advancements can be made. It can be further enhance to increase accuracy.
